Federated-Quasar combines the idea of a quasar, representing immense energy and activity, with "federated," suggesting unity or collaboration among different components or entities within the system. 
This name implies a system that brings together various resources or entities in a coordinated and efficient manner, much like how a quasar emits energy across vast distances in the universe.
